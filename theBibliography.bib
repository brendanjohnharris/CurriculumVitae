Standard methods of dimensionality reduction excel at finding global low-dimensional structure, but do not provide crucial fine-grained information about how the dynamics of individual neural elements change over time. As an alternative, univariate time-series features measure the dynamical properties of local neural elements, but most assume stationary data in which dynamical properties are constant. We present a new method that combines time-series features with dimensionality reduction to produce interpretable, time-resolved summaries of non-stationary data. By exploiting the correspondence between parameters and dynamics [1], we are then able to infer the parametric variation underlying non-stationarity in complex neural dynamics.
                        Our method (Fig. 1) first applies feature extraction [2] to windows of a time series, yielding a feature matrix that measures dynamical properties across time. We then infer parametric variation by applying dimensionality reduction to the feature matrix, extracting the trajectory of local time-series windows through a low-dimensional feature space. To ensure our feature-space embedding is unbiased with respect to feature–feature dependencies, we also developed an extension to PCA that generates orthonormal features by examining the dependency structure of a controlled, baseline, dataset. We verified our methods are able to accurately track non-stationarity and the underlying variation in ground-truth parameters using an extensive variety of simulated dynamical systems (correlations from 0.9 to 1.0).
                        We then investigated neural responses to visual stimuli by applying our method to the Allen Neuropixels dataset, a spatio-temporal set of electrophysiological recordings from the mouse brain [3]. As a visual stimulus changes over time, our method automatically reveals channels that transition between states with distinct patterns of activity. In a single subject, we are able to temporally resolve the dynamical regimes of regions such as the primary visual cortex and lateral posterior nucleus, which include slow, periodic theta oscillations and higher-frequency broadband fluctuations, without aggregating local readings over imposed anatomical divisions (as required by most conventional methods).
                        Our new method has further advantages over conventional approaches to dimensionality reduction: i) it does not require phase-synchronized time series; ii) it produces an informative low-dimensional representation of complex dynamics, resolved over space and time; and iii) it can be directly interpreted in terms of the dynamical properties encapsulated by each feature, without the need to identify a model for the underlying system.

  abstract         = {Perceptual and cognitive processing relies on flexible communication among cortical areas; however, the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here we report a mechanism based on the realistic spatiotemporal dynamics of propagating wave patterns in neural population activity. Using a biophysically plausible, multiarea spiking neural circuit model, we demonstrate that these wave patterns, characterized by their rich and complex dynamics, can account for a wide variety of empirically observed neural processes. The coordinated interactions of these wave patterns give rise to distributed and dynamic communication (DDC) that enables flexible and rapid routing of neural activity across cortical areas. We elucidate how DDC unifies the previously proposed oscillation synchronization-based and subspace-based views of interareal communication, offering experimentally testable predictions that we validate through the analysis of Allen Institute Neuropixels data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DDC can be effectively modulated during attention tasks through the interplay of neuromodulators and cortical feedback loops. This modulation process explains many neural effects of attention, underscoring the fundamental functional role of DDC in cognition.},

  abstract         = {Neural dynamics bridge anatomy and function over diverse scales [1], from microscopic spiking to mesoscale LFPs [2] and macroscopic
traveling waves [3, 4, 5]. We report a new nested dynamical pattern in the mouse visual cortex, comprising: i) large-scale θ waves that
propagate across cortical layers and regions; ii) short, localized γ packets that reflect focused processing; and iii) cross-scale coupling
between θ waves, γ packets, and spikes (illustrated in Fig. 1A). This flexible dynamical motif aligns with feed-forward/feed-back anatomical
features of the visual hierarchy and cortical laminae, while also carrying significant top-down/bottom-up functional information that predicts
change-detection performance. Our findings suggest that such distributed cross-scale patterns form a general ‘spatiotemporal θ–γ code’
for efficiently modulating and multiplexing neural information.
We used wave-based methods to analyze the ‘Allen Neuropixels–Visual Behavior’ dataset, illustrated in Fig. 1B, which comprises
multi-region laminar recordings from the mouse visual cortex. After systematically mapping local field potential spectra to identify dominant
timescales, we characterized θ as a traveling wave using the instantaneous phase (Fig. 1D) and quantified translaminar propagation with
the negative spatial phase gradient (see Fig. 1E). We then used the instantaneous amplitude to detect non-stationary, spatially localized
γ packets across layers (Fig. 1F). Finally, by extended classical phase–amplitude coupling measures, we detected spatiotemporal θ–γ
interactions that coordinate large-scale traveling θ waves with localized γ packets (illustrated in Fig. 1G) and neuronal spiking.
All regions exhibited clear θ-band (3–10 Hz) and γ-band (30–100 Hz) peaks. We also discovered a robust spectral gradient along the
visual cortical hierarchy [6], with θ strength increasing toward deep layers (median Kendall’s τ = 0.37, p < 10−7) and higher regions
(0.25 < τ < 0.60 across layers, all p < 0.01). θ displayed striking bidirectional, nonstationary propagation during visual tasks, switching
from a deep-to-superficial feed-back mode after onset to a superficial-to-deep feed-forward mode after offset. θ also propagated from
higher to lower areas near stimulus onset, but in the reverse direction following offset. Furthermore, translaminar θ propagation (prior to
reaction) predicted ‘hit/miss’ change-detection performance, with a balanced accuracy of 0.65 ± 0.11 (median ± IQR across sessions, 5
folds, 20 repeats, p < 10−13). Together, these results indicate that θ plays a dual functional role in visual cognition.
γ, on the other hand, formed spatiotemporal wave packets, which became spatially localized after stimulus onset. γ packets were also
locked to θ waves, particularly in layer 1 of lower-order areas and layer 6 of higher-order regions. Moreover, γ packets in superficial layers
tended to prefer θ troughs, whereas deep layers preferred the falling edge. This θ–γ locking was mirrored in the relationship between
LFP and neuronal spiking, where spikes tracked fluctuations in γ power and exhibited similar layer-specific preferences of θ phase.
Based on our findings, we introduce a spatiotemporal θ–γ code that provides a general mechanism for multiplexing and integrating
fine-grained top-down and bottom-up information across cortical layers and brain regions. Our wave-based framework ties local cross-scale
coupling [7] and inter-areal phase synchrony [8] into a coherent, nested pattern of neuronal spiking, γ packets, and θ traveling waves,
highlighting the crucial role of large-scale dynamics in shaping the fine-grained processes needed to interpret complex natural stimuli.},
