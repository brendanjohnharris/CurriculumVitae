Univariate time-series features can measure the dynamical properties of local neural elements, but most assume stationary data in which dynamical properties are constant.

In a single subject, we temporally resolve the dynamical regimes of regions such as the primary visual cortex and lateral posterior nucleus, which include slow, periodic theta oscillations and higher-frequency broadband fluctuations, without aggregating local readings over imposed anatomical divisions. Unlike conventional approaches to dimensionality reduction, our new method: i) does not require phase-synchronized time series; ii) produces an informative low-dimensional representation of complex dynamics, resolved over space and time; and iii) can be directly interpreted in terms of the dynamical properties encapsulated by each feature, without needing to identify a model for the underlying system.

Standard methods of dimensionality reduction excel at finding global low-dimensional structure, but do not provide crucial fine-grained information about how the dynamics of individual neural elements change over time. As an alternative, univariate time-series features measure the dynamical properties of local neural elements, but most assume stationary data in which dynamical properties are constant. We present a new method that combines time-series features with dimensionality reduction to produce interpretable, time-resolved summaries of non-stationary data. By exploiting the correspondence between parameters and dynamics [1], we are then able to infer the parametric variation underlying non-stationarity in complex neural dynamics.
Our method (Fig. 1) first applies feature extraction [2] to windows of a time series, yielding a feature matrix that measures dynamical properties across time. We then infer parametric variation by applying dimensionality reduction to the feature matrix, extracting the trajectory of local time-series windows through a low-dimensional feature space. To ensure our feature-space embedding is unbiased with respect to feature–feature dependencies, we also developed an extension to PCA that generates orthonormal features by examining the dependency structure of a controlled, baseline, dataset. We verified our methods are able to accurately track non-stationarity and the underlying variation in ground-truth parameters using an extensive variety of simulated dynamical systems (correlations from 0.9 to 1.0).
We then investigated neural responses to visual stimuli by applying our method to the Allen Neuropixels dataset, a spatio-temporal set of electrophysiological recordings from the mouse brain [3]. As a visual stimulus changes over time, our method automatically reveals channels that transition between states with distinct patterns of activity. In a single subject, we are able to temporally resolve the dynamical regimes of regions such as the primary visual cortex and lateral posterior nucleus, which include slow, periodic theta oscillations and higher-frequency broadband fluctuations, without aggregating local readings over imposed anatomical divisions (as required by most conventional methods).
Our new method has further advantages over conventional approaches to dimensionality reduction: i) it does not require phase-synchronized time series; ii) it produces an informative low-dimensional representation of complex dynamics, resolved over space and time; and iii) it can be directly interpreted in terms of the dynamical properties encapsulated by each feature, without the need to identify a model for the underlying system. Our approach can be applied to many forms of spatio-temporal neural data to understand how the dynamics of neural components respond to changes in the environment.
